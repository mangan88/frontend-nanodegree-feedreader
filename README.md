I referred to the code presented in the companion course for this project for Asynchronous test setup (beforeEach, done()).
I referred to StackExchange.com for help in testing CSS class presence (menu-hidden).
I referred to the Udacity Discussion forums for help with the final test. Upon
Project review, I again referred to the Discussion forums and learned more about
 the done() function, which allowed me to complete the test.
